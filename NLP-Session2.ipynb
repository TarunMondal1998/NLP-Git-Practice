So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing.\n"
